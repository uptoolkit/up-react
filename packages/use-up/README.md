# Use Up

## Why ?

🥸 : Bootstrapping a project is unexpectedly very difficult because there are so many choices, too many setups and configs to do before just working on a project...

😩 : "Hell yeah, you're right. Javascript fatigue..."

🥸 : Up React help you to have everything you need to start for creating a webapp as simple as that :

- [React for the Javascript framework](https://reactjs.org/)
- [Tailwind as a Front-End Utilities](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- [DaisyUI a Tailwind components extension](https://daisyui.com/)
- [AntDesign as Ui Library](https://ant.design/)
- [Axios for the ajax request](https://axios-http.com/)
- [I18n for the translations helpers](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@cherrypulp/i18n)
- [JsConfigHelper for config provider](https://www.npmjs.com/package/js-config-helper)
- [JsFormHelper as form helper](https://www.npmjs.com/package/js-form-helper)
- [DayJS as date helper](https://day.js.org/)

🧐 : "Mmh, interesting..."

🥸 : At the best, you can just use our components or layouts making a breeze for your quick prototyping or web development with everything to start included and UP to date.

🧐 : "Mmh, yes but what if I want to..."

🥸 : Shut ! I know your dev syndrom... At the minimum, you will have a good boilerplate and UP to you to
override it when you will feel the need. Thanks to our "[convention over configuration philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convention_over_configuration)" and [S.O.L.I.D principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID) :-).

😁 : "Ok now I want to start !!!"

## Getting started

There is also a Next.js boilerplate available here : [https://github.com/uptoolkit/upfront-nextjs](https://github.com/uptoolkit/upfront-nextjs)

In your React project just make :

````bash
yarn add use-up #or npm i use-up --save
````

REM : for more tools to use => you can check out also up-react [https://github.com/uptoolkit/up-react](https://github.com/uptoolkit/up-react)

Then in your main app (likely very soon in your app instanciation), do :

````javascript
// this will be likely in your main.js or pages/__app.js in Next
import React from 'react'
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom'
import './index.css'
import App from './App'
import {useUp} from 'use-up';

//1. You must instanciate the useUp singleton
useUp({
  debug: true,
  project : {
    name: 'Up Toolkit Demo',
    logo: {
      src: '/img/logo.svg',
    },
    url: '/'
  },
  storeMode: 'reactive', // could be reactive|redux
  api: {
    url: 'https://uptoolkit/demo/api', // Replace with your api endpoint
  },
  translations: {
    en_EN: {
      hello: 'Hello World !',
    },
    fr_FR: {
      hello: 'Bonjour le monde',
    },
  },
  locale: 'en_EN',
  locales: [
    'en_EN', 'fr_FR'
  ],
});

ReactDOM.render(
  <React.StrictMode>
    <App />
  </React.StrictMode>,
  document.getElementById('root')
)
````

Then in your component you can simply use the useUp() helper : 

````javascript
import {useState} from 'react'
import {useUp} from 'use-up';

function App() {

  const {
    config, // config helper
    api, // api helper
    t, // translation helper
  } = useUp();

  return (
    <div className="App">
      <header className="App-header">
        {config.get('project.name')}
        {t('hello')}
      </header>
    </div>
  )
}
````

# What if I need to adapt or don't need a components ?

UseUp use a convention over configuration principle but also a S.O.L.I.D design pattern. 

It means that you can override everything if you follow the Typed interface conventions.

To override an element in your initialisation config, just do : 

`````javascript
useUp({
  override: {
    api: MyCustomApiService,
    message: MyOtherMessagePlugin
  },
  exclude: [
    'notification',
    'i18n'
  ]
});
`````
